- implement support for default values (daycounter)

- retain old copyrights

- fix support for ValueObjects / serialization

- in linux QuantLibAddin build don't enter m4 subdir

- configure swig so that "make install" delivers the file reposit.swg file to
  the install directory then configure QuantLibAddin to run swig from the
  install directory rather than from the swig source tree.

- get swig working off the official QuantLib *.i files

- implement validation to check for addin function names that cause conflicts
  in Excel (for example a function name in the range A1-XFD1048576 that also
  corresponds to the name of a cell on the big grid)
